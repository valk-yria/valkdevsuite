# Valkyria's Development Suite

## NOTE
Due to exporting oversights, this repo does **not** include the Resources folder that the plugin requires.
I am already improving the object instantiation system to not rely on non-script objects for better visibility.

- If you wish to modify the code, you are recommended to import it with Roblox's `InsertService` for better debugging and a smoother workflow. See the [IMPORT.md](https://github.com/valk-yria/valkdevsuite/blob/master/IMPORT.md) file for more information.
- If you just want to use the plugin, use this [link](https://www.roblox.com/library/6988231623/Valkyrias-Development-Suite). 

*Note that both of these actions will require a Roblox account and Roblox Studio installed.*

## ABOUT
Valkyria's Development Suite is a Roblox plugin designed with level designers in mind. Comes equipped with tools including map part count, lighting, waypoints, and more.

Note that this is still a work in progress.
